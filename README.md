# Energy Analysis of a Mesh Network using NS3 Network Simulator

## AIM
To conduct Energy Analysis of a mesh network and get in- sight about the duration of effective operation of the nodes.The simulator used for this purpose is an open source network simulator called NS3 and ireshark is used as a packet sniffer.

## MOTIVATION
Over the past several years the topics of energy consumption and energy harvesting have gained significant importance as a means for improved operation of wireless sensor and mesh networks. Energy-awareness of operation is especially relevant for application scenarios from the domain of environmental monitoring in hard to access areas. With our work we aim to shed some light on energy-aware network operation and to help both users and developers in the planning and deployment of a new wireless (mesh) network for environmental research and other applications.
